Graceful degradation is about making sure a website stays functional even when some features or resources fail. Service workers play a key role in this by allowing a site to load from cached files when the network is slow or completely unavailable. This means the app can still provide a basic experience, even without a live connection. Instead of breaking or showing an error, the site adapts to what is available, which is the core idea behind graceful degradation.
